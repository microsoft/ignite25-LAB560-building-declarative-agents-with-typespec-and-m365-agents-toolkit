## LAB560 - Building Declarative Agents with TypeSpec and M365 Agents Toolkit


### Session Description

Learn how to create intelligent, task-oriented Copilot agents using the native Microsoft 365 Copilot stack. In this hands-on lab, you'll use TypeSpec, a type safe language to write agent specification and the Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit to build Declarative agents that integrate seamlessly with third party as well as Microsoft 365 services.

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lab, you will:

- Design and build Declarative Copilot agents using TypeSpec and the Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit with confidence.
- Gain hands-on experience authoring type-safe agent definitions.
- Deploy agents that execute tasks intelligently within the Microsoft 365 Copilot ecosystem, without writing imperative orchestration logic.
- Learn how to integrate an existing API service with your agent.
- Explore additional capabilities that can be added to enhance your agent.
